# Open Coin Flip

This is an app I made a while ago when I was trying out MIT AppInventor. It's a very simple coin-flipping game. I switched out the clipart I had originally found for new some pictures I made so that I could release this. I know that there are plenty of other apps that are much better than this, but I wanted to release this so that new programmers could hopefully learn something from this!
